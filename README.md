# Instacart-Basket-Analysis-Python
Instacart-Basket-Analysis-Python: An exploratory data analysis project to uncover sales patterns and optimize marketing strategies.
I utilized Python for data wrangling and analysis on multiple Instacart datasets. Subsequently, I developed a report detailing my analysis process, results, and strategic recommendations addressing key business questions for Instacart.

**Objective**
Instacart, a digital grocery service operating via an app, is keen to gain deeper insights into their sales trends despite already achieving robust sales figures. Your assignment involves conducting preliminary data exploration and analysis to extract insights and propose strategies for enhanced market segmentation based on provided metrics.

**Key Questions

    What are the peak days and hours for orders, and when are they least busy to optimize ad scheduling?
    At what times do customers spend the most, and how can this influence product advertising?
    How can products be grouped into simpler price ranges to aid marketing and sales efforts?
    Which product categories have the highest order frequencies?
    How do different customer types and their ordering behaviors vary? Consider:
        User distribution based on brand loyalty and their return rate to Instacart.
        Order patterns by loyalty status and geographic location.
        Links between age, family status, and ordering habits.
        Demographic-based classifications like age, income, and family status.
        Variations in ordering habits considering order value, frequency, products, and more.

**Data**

    Orders
    Orders_products_prior
    Products
    Customers
    Departments

The customer dataset and 'prices' column were added for educational purposes as part of the Career Foundry course.

**Tools**
The analysis employed Python along with these libraries:

    Pandas: for data manipulation
    Numpy: for numerical operations
    Seaborn: for visualization
    Matplotlib: for visualization
    Scipy: for scientific calculations
    Warnings: to suppress warnings

**Folders**
Project files are organized as follows:

    Project Management: Includes Project Brief and Data Dictionary.
    Data: Contains Original Data and Prepared Data subfolders, with raw and cleaned data respectively. (Data files are not uploaded to GitHub due to size constraints.)
    Scripts: Jupyter notebooks for the analysis.
    Analysis: Visualizations folder with charts and graphs used for insights.
    Sent to Client: Final report in Excel format.

**Resources**
Instacart, a real company, has provided data for public use, though the project brief content was created by CareerFoundry for educational purposes.
